Remember that some of these commands might require administrative privileges, so you might need to prepend sudo before them to execute them as a superuser. Always refer to the man pages or documentation for each command to understand their options and usage in more detail (man command_name).

Additionally, the networking tools and commands available can vary between different versions of Ubuntu and Linux distributions, so it's a good idea to refer to your distribution's documentation or community resources for specific guidance.
